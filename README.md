Hello! I am a software engineer and UCLA Alum passionate about working with data to extract actionable insights. I have experience working with many kinds of data including time-series data, and working with data pipelines and automation tools like Airflow to automate data cleaning and transforming. I also bring valuable client-side experience in full-stack web development, applying it to create dashboards that help communicate insights with data analysis.
